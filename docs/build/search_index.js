The two measurements with the smallest distance are grouped together to form the first agglomerative cluster. In the next iteration, the newly generated cluster is then represented by either its mean, minimum or its maximum for the distance calculations. It should be noted that there are several ways to calculate the distance between two measurements (e.g. Euclidean distance and Mahalanobis distance).

This matrix may be indicated with different symbols such as Sigma_n times n. The D_n times n matrix in the geometrical space represents an act of stretching. Each singular value is the degree and/or weight of stretching. We use the notation D_n times n to remind ourselves that this is a diagonal matrix. Finally, V_n times n^T is called the right singular matrix and is associated with rotation.
