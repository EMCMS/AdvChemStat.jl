The two measurements with the smallest distance are grouped together to form the first agglomerative cluster. In the next iteration, the newly generated cluster is then represented by either its mean, minimum or its maximum for the distance calculations. It should be noted that there are several ways to calculate the distance between two measurements (e.g. Euclidean distance and Mahalanobis distance).
